# A Rational Model of Career Decision-Making Under Individual Utilitarianism

## Abstract

This paper presents a formal model for career decision-making based on *Individual Utilitarianism* (IU)—a rationalist ethical framework that asserts the maximization of one's own long-term subjective utility as the sole normative principle. We demonstrate that six core dimensions—passion, aptitude, financial sustainability, lifestyle compatibility, social support, and work-life balance—collectively constitute the most rational and comprehensive structure for evaluating career options under IU. These elements are justified through their causal relationship with subjective well-being and internal consistency with the IU framework. A formal structure, diagrammatic representations, and practical implications are discussed.

## 1. Introduction

Career decisions are among the most consequential choices individuals make, often shaping identity, lifestyle, and psychological well-being over decades. Traditional approaches to career planning include personality-based models, market forecasting, or societal expectations. However, under the ethical framework of *Individual Utilitarianism* (IU), a radically personal and rational approach is required.

IU posits that individuals should act to maximize their own long-term subjective utility—defined as conscious well-being over time. Within this model, every choice must be justified solely through its capacity to enhance or sustain the individual's internal experience of value. This paper operationalizes IU in the context of career planning, arguing that six key dimensions are the most causally and structurally significant for maximizing individual utility in a career path.

## 2. Foundations of Individual Utilitarianism

**Individual Utilitarianism** is founded on the following axioms:

1. **Subjective Utility as Sole Value**: Only the agent's own conscious experience holds intrinsic moral weight.
2. **Rational Self-Consistency**: Moral principles and actions must form a coherent, logically deducible system.
3. **Temporal Continuity**: Utility is accumulated over time; therefore, decisions must consider long-term impact.

In this light, all career decisions must answer the question: *"Which path maximizes my long-term subjective well-being through sustainable, rational means?"*

## 3. The Six Dimensions of Rational Career Evaluation

We propose that the following six dimensions provide a complete framework for evaluating any career option under IU. Each dimension is selected for its robust and empirically verifiable connection to subjective utility.

### 3.1 Passion (Intrinsic Enjoyment)
- Activities aligned with intrinsic interest are strongly correlated with flow states, internal motivation, and day-to-day psychological satisfaction.
- Passion increases engagement and resilience, reducing existential fatigue.

### 3.2 Aptitude (Ability Fit)
- Individuals excel when they operate within their cognitive and skill-based strengths.
- Success reinforces self-worth and brings validation, both of which contribute to self-perceived utility.

### 3.3 Financial Sustainability
- Money is instrumental: it secures freedom, access to experiences, and protection against volatility.
- IU demands not wealth maximization, but income sufficient to sustain one's desired lifestyle and reduce anxiety.

### 3.4 Lifestyle Compatibility (Location, Hours, Flexibility)
- The structure of a career must fit the broader goals of one’s desired life: location, routine, freedom.
- Incompatibility can diminish long-term utility even in otherwise well-paying or prestigious roles.

### 3.5 Social & Familial Support
- Social reinforcement contributes to emotional stability and minimizes interpersonal conflict.
- Careers with community approval and familial support tend to reduce friction and cognitive dissonance.

### 3.6 Work-Life Balance
- Excessive work or unpredictability increases stress, reducing long-term well-being.
- Balance permits diversification of meaningful activities (relationships, hobbies), maximizing multi-dimensional utility.

## 4. Structural Coherence of the Model

From the standpoint of IU, these six dimensions are not arbitrarily chosen but arise necessarily from the nature of subjective utility:

- **Exhaustiveness**: Together, they cover all domains that significantly impact the conscious experience.
- **Interdependence**: Each dimension interacts with the others (e.g., aptitude increases financial returns, balance maintains passion).
- **Trade-off Modeling**: The model enables rational trade-offs (e.g., accepting lower pay for better lifestyle).

## 6. Practical Implications

- **Strategic Planning**: IU encourages introspection and future-state modeling rather than reactive choice.
- **Adaptive Iteration**: The model supports career pivoting if long-term utility begins to decline.
- **Resistance to Social Pressure**: IU allows rational disengagement from careers chosen out of conformity.

## 7. Conclusion

Under Individual Utilitarianism, the individual becomes both the subject and object of moral inquiry. In choosing a career, the only valid ethical consideration is: *Does this path sustainably increase my own conscious well-being?* The six-factor model—passion, aptitude, financial return, lifestyle fit, social support, and balance—offers a rational, complete, and internally consistent framework for answering that question.

In an age where external markers of success often obscure inner value, IU provides a moral compass back to the self—rational, deliberate, and deeply human.
